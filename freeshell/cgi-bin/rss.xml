         <title>The First Diwali Meet</title>
         <link>http://ctae.blogspot.com/2010/11/first-diwali-meet.html</link>
         <description>&lt;div&gt;Just out of the blue the idea of meet came to my mind. May be because it has been long, 10 years, that I have seen many of my classmates. I started planning about 2 months ago. And with help and support of friends the event was successful. 22 people gathered at the venue. We all had lots of discussion, promises on meeting often, snacks, drinks, dinner and much more. As expected some &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;nautanki&lt;/span&gt;. I'll keep the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;nautanki&lt;/span&gt; part secret and let the attendees only enjoy the memories of it. Here is how I started.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;   &lt;iframe class=&quot;embeddedvideo&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; src=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I posted on Facebook about the meet. I actually created an event on the CTAE fan page. And it was wow! The response from the CTAE people in India and abroad was overwhelming. 16 people agreed to attend the event. 35 may be. 60 not attending. 102 did not respond. 16 was good enough figure to keep me motivated. I started calling people who are not on Facebook. I collected around 30 phone numbers and called up everybody. Got positive response from all of them. I felt really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I called up Vinod Sharma (2001), who is in Jaipur. And shared the idea. Vinod also got charged up. He promised me to make all the arrangements in Jaipur. From calling and coordinating with the Jaipur CTAEians to booking the venue, all credit goes to Vinod. And the result was a gathering of 22 CTAEians. People gathered from different batches, from different so called groups, all branches and different cities. All came to Jaipur, on the roof top restaurant of the hotel Royal Orchid.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off at 7:00 AM in the morning from New Delhi and reached Jaipur at 12:00 noon. Left for KG's (Sharma) house at 3:00 PM. He had some work so I slept for some time. Then we headed towards Vinod's place. And then to KG Kumawat's house. From KG's (Kumat) house we called up most of the friends once again. I was happy because a most of them were on their way. After having the evening tea at KG's house we left for the venue. We reached at the hotel at 7:00 PM. Guys from Sikar (four of them) were already there, they were just roaming around the hotel to find a &lt;i&gt;chai ki thadi&lt;/i&gt;. I am really sorry &lt;i&gt;Chai&lt;/i&gt; was not included in our menu. But I promise, we'll include that the next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around 8:00 PM most of us were at the venue. Following were the attendees: Anand Singh Jodha, Jitendra Singh Shekhawat, Kishan Gopal Kumawat, Krishan Gopal Sharma, Mahipal Singh, N. S. Shekhawat, Pankaj Jangid, Prabhu Dayal Aggarwal, R. S. Shekhawat, Rahul Garg, Rajesh Maloo, Sanjay Jain, Santosh Narayan Sharma, Saurabh Gautam, Surender Sharma, Vaibhav Goswami, Vikas Sharma, Vikash Jangid, Vinod Sharma, Vivek Mishra, Vivek Saxena, Shubhkaran Singh Dahiya. Thank you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were many new faces. So we started with introductions. Some of us work in IT, some doing government engineering jobs and a few own businesses. Some were doing non-engineering jobs like sales/marketing/banking. Shubhkaran is running his own NGO since we were in college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of us promised to create a strong alumni. I am hoping to see more and more people in such meets. Do give suggestions for future meets.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;

         <title>Public Provident Fund (PPF) for investment and tax saving</title>
         <link>http://blog.moneyraam.com/2010/06/public-provident-fund-ppf-for-investment-and-tax-saving.html</link>
         <description>Most of the times, when individuals talk about tax saving or investments, they usually look at Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIPs) and Mutual Funds (ELSS). No doubt both these methods of investment are most popular, but there are other avenues that investors tend to ignore. These alternate investment options have their own benefits and should [...]

         <description>If you are planning to invest in ULIP, at this date ICICI Prudential Ace seems to be the best plan to invest in. You will not see a lot of advertisements of this plan.

         <description>Please refer the product brochure before concluding the sale. You would have heard this many times in advertisements, but how many of us while investing in ULIP, do read the product brochure.

         <title>A Small Advice To Save Fuel</title>
         <link>http://sciencedrill.blogspot.com/2009/01/small-advice-to-save-fuel.html</link>
         <description>The trick is to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;minimize use of breaks&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how to avoid accidents without using breaks? I am not saying don't use breaks but I am insisting on minimizing there use. You need a little judgment while driving. &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drive at a distance of at least 70-100m from the car in front. And instead of applying breaks at a distance when you are about to the car in front, stop the fuel supply immediately when you see the front car retarding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Usually we drive on the same roads everyday. And we know of all the speed bumps that come on the way. Use the same logic, start retarding 70-100m before the obstacle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;But how this will save fuel? That's the principle of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Conservation of Energy&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you press the accelerator, the engine is supplied with the fuel and chemical energy stored in fuel is converted into mechanical energy by the engine, which helps the car move ahead. Now when you press breaks, some form of friction is applied to stop the car and heat is produced at the point of friction. The mechanical energy got wasted as heat. Waste of fuel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this small advice will help you save some fuel.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;

         <title>Probability of Finding Life Elsewhere</title>
         <link>http://sciencedrill.blogspot.com/2009/01/probability-of-finding-life-elsewhere.html</link>
         <description>I would say 1.0. I don't know why but my senses say that the possibility of finding life elsewhere in universe is 100%. Universe is so vast I cannot imagine that no one is there in this deep black see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mathematically, probability of finding an item of type T in a box of volume V is 0.0 if the volume is infinitesimally small. And probability is 1.0 if the volume of box is very large, so large that it contains the whole earth. The universe is infinite in its volume. That's why the probability of finding life in universe is 1.0. Even if we remove earth from that volume, the total volume has virtually not effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you say?&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;

         <title>The Grand Weightloss Party</title>
         <link>http://lifedrill.blogspot.com/2007/08/grand-weightloss-party.html</link>
         <description>About a month ago we all (Abhilash, Dinesh and Me) started going to the company gymnasium with different motives. Despite having good looks, Abhilash had a misunderstanding that he doesn't look good. And to rectify that he started regular workout everyday. Me want to build some muscle now. I know it is late. But it is never late you know. Dinesh has a deep back and want to fill that with muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/jangid/1195680949/&quot; title=&quot;The Host and The Guest&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer;cursor:hand;width:320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1153/1195680949_87ce7cb427.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many things happen on our way to wisdom. Dinesh separated from as he joined Sequence Design. But Abhilash's achievement was surprising. He lost 10 Kg in a month. Check his full advice at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://kahani-zindagi-ki.blogspot.com/2007/08/blog-post_7519.html&quot;&gt;http://kahani-zindagi-ki.blogspot.com/2007/08/blog-post_7519.html&lt;/a&gt;. And we need no more reasons to celebrate. We started asking for a party when he lost 9.5 Kg. He promised to throw a party when he complete a 10 Kg loss. We said ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Abhilash tried hard to keep his weight loss below 10 Kg but yesterday he was 11.5 Kg less then from where he started. We reminded him of his promise. Ripul insisted on a dinner party. But we couldn't decide. After sometime Abhilash leaked the secret of Dal-Bati. And Ripul again insisted on a dinner party with Dal-Bati in the course. Abhilash agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/jangid/1195700057/&quot; title=&quot;Digestion with Vajra-Asana&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer;cursor:hand;width:320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1230/1195700057_472741faf0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of us left office at 5:00 PM. Abhilash went home to help Uma prepare a nice treat for all of us and we (Ripul and me) headed towards my home to pick Sarita and Naini. Then picked up Preeti from her office and reached Kendriya Vihar, Sector 50, NOIDA at Abhilash's residence for a mouth watering supper. Rahul was busy in some teleconference so could not attend the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All had more than twice our usual capacity. The meal was so tasty that we couldn't resist taking more and more and more...seriously. Now I know the secret behind Abhilash's weight gain. Abhilash resisted too much but couldn't help much. He also ate twice then his usual diet. Then we had sweets also. Over all a very well hosted treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Abhilash and Uma for the best hospitality. But Abhilash, now you should start eating full diet, leaving your specialized low calorie meal. Now you look super cool.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;

         <title>Perception of Right or Wrong</title>
         <link>http://lifedrill.blogspot.com/2007/08/perception-of-right-or-wrong.html</link>
         <description>Many times we all have seen that someone is doing something wrong. And we simply don't understand why that someone is doing it that way. Even if you talk to him about his wrong doings he will not accept it. He thinks he is doing right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our company bus driver drives very rash. For him, there is no meaning of speed limits indicated on boards on the roadside. And he is always in hurry. He can't wait much for people giving way to him on road. I don't remember the bus horn silent for more than 20 seconds in a moderate traffic condition. He keeps pressing it without seeing that the person driving in front of him is also in hurry and he also has to reach somewhere as soon as possible. Our driver thinks that only he has to reach office and no one else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day after reaching office, when I was getting down, I asked the driver, &quot;&lt;font style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Kyon itna horn bajate ho bhai&lt;/font&gt;&quot; (brother, why do you use so much horn). He smiled and innocently said, &quot;&lt;font style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Sir horn nahin bajaenge to koi side nahin dega&lt;/font&gt;&quot; (Sir if I don't blow horn then no one will give us way). And the next day also he was driving the same way again, no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we look at it closely, we'll find that nothing is wrong with the driver. It is only the way how he perceive things as right and wrong. He grew up in such a surrounding where he was not told about what is right and what is wrong? So he sees things slightly differently. Similar to the drivers case another example would be the terrorists who are spread all over the world. They kill people and do not regret also. They see this as right because no one has taught them that it is wrong. In the terrorist camps young people are trained by changing there perception of right and wrong. They are brain washed. So that they don't feel sorry while killing someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar is the case when we are sitting in a meeting room, discussing over a design. Sometimes despite having a better design in front of us we tend to stick to what we have proposed. And we try to prove the superiority of our proposed design over the better one. Here ego is more power full element then the perception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have millions of cells in our brain, working together to enable our body to judge right and wrong in various circumstances. Keeping our mind surrounded with nice and right thoughts could make our minds better decision making devices.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;

         <title>Happy Independence Day</title>
         <link>http://lifedrill.blogspot.com/2007/08/happy-independence-day.html</link>
         <description>Congratulations India. Congratulations All of Us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is celebrating 60th Independence Day today. We celebrated the Independence in our society by organizing a flag hosting ceremony followed by sports activities. All were happy, especially kids who got gifts. Those who won got special prizes. Naini and Dhruv also got special prizes for best dressed girl and boy (see photo). &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/jangid/archives/date-taken/2007/08/15/&quot;&gt;Click here to see all photos taken on 15 August, 2007&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jangid/1123025393/&quot; title=&quot;Naini &amp;amp; Dhruv&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer;cursor:hand;width:320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1212/1123025393_245d952300.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Naini &amp;amp; Dhruv&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from this I watched the movie &quot;Shaheed&quot; that was being played on Doordharshan. I have watched this movie many times but the freshness is still there. I can watch it infinite times. I would like to request here to the producer to digitally enhance the movie and convert it to color. So many movies are being converted why not such a great movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from this I did something really crazy; most people will say so but I don't care. I started a blog called &quot;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; title=&quot;Pragatisheel&quot;&gt;Pragatisheel&lt;/a&gt;&quot; on this occasion. I'll document all the discussions related to development of India in this blog. The discussion that happen among our friends, on road, in market, in reality shows, anywhere. And the blog entries will be in Hindi (हिन्दी). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So enjoy everybody. And write how you celebrated the Independence Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jai Hind.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;

         <title>Science is Fun</title>
         <link>http://sciencedrill.blogspot.com/2007/08/science-is-fun.html</link>
         <description>When I was in school and even now, many questions come to tinker my mind. For example:-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. How do we think? Are thoughts some physical thing inside our body?&lt;br /&gt;Q. How do we hear? What exactly happen in our ears when we hear something?&lt;br /&gt;Q. How do we see?&lt;br /&gt;Q. Why human body doesn't digest it's own parts when it can digest any non-vegetarian thing eaten?&lt;br /&gt;Q. Why blood group matters? What is +ve and -ve in a blood group code?&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the list goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this blog I'll try put answers to such general questions by finding them on the web. And I'll definitely put links to the original resources from where I have found answers to the questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among other things I'll put experiments that I used to perform at home to learn something new. I swear I'll start doing them again as soon as possible. It was a lot of fun. I thoroughly enjoyed doing those experiments. I hope this will help many school students also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am now working in Computer Science field, I'll also try to put some funny programming exercises which may help high school students. I'll also try to put some puzzles to give an exercise to your brain. I love doing mathematics. So be prepared for some maths also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be a lot of fun.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;

         <title>Vashi Days of NCST</title>
         <link>http://lifedrill.blogspot.com/2007/08/vashi-days-of-ncst.html</link>
         <description>Today I got few old photos from Rahul. Luckily he had those NCST photos also when the NCST, New Bombay centre was at Vashi, right above the Vashi railway station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jangid/1020078934/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1291/1020078934_50437fc6a6_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Inside NCST Vashi Centre&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo shows 90% of the Vashi team (Binoy, Jacob, Bhavana, Dharmesh, Pankaj and Ripul). Subbu and Meghna are missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me used to come from Powai, Ripul from Bombay central. Mostly we joined each other at Kurla while going to office in the morning. In the evening most of the days we left office at around 9:00 PM, till we both shifted to NCST rented residence at Seawoods Complex between Belapur and Vashi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember we used to eat Jacobs Dabba (lunch box) for lunch and then used to go for Pops Jumbo Vada-Pav. Sometimes other places also especially Alibaba for a Chinese treat. In the evening we used to eat at home till we shifted to Seawoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shifting the Seawoods team grew to 6 (Sasi, Joju, Pankaj, Ripul, Dharmesh, Prem) and hence we planned to cook our dinner ourself. Sasi and Joju and Prem also were the coach for our team and within no time we became South Indian cooking expert. I was assigned the task of cutting vegetables and later given the designation of Official Vegetable Cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice days.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;

         <title>Pizza Party @ The Great India Place</title>
         <link>http://lifedrill.blogspot.com/2007/08/pizza-party-great-india-place.html</link>
         <description>After a long time I went to Pizza Hut today (actually yesterday as the day is crossed) with my cab mates. Occasion was &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Just Like That&lt;/span&gt;. We decided to visit the newly opened Pizza Hut at The Great India Place. Umm... the pizza was really tasty. Normally I don't like pizzas as I got bored of eating it and moreover I have heard a lot about it's bad effects on health due to white flour used in it. But I liked it this time; due to taste. The food was great, ambiance was also good and the mall is also the best in India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thought of starting at 12:30 PM but started at 12:45 PM. As usual everyone started at 12:30 from there cubicles and gathers at the Cadence's gate after 15 precious minutes. Atish was the last person to join us. Surprizingly Manik was the first it seems. Actually when I came out Manik and Rahul were standing outside so I am just guessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went into Manik and Samir's cars. Me, Atish, Chayan and Rahul went with Manik; Samita, Manish and Arpita went with Samir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On reaching The Great India Place I went to Pantaloon to take my altered pants. While other ordered the Garlic Bread. After I return from Pantaloon and joined the vegetarian gang we ordered a medium Spicy Veggie and a medium Veggie Supreme pizza for ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having the nice lunch we return office at 2:30 PM. Over all a 2 hour fun. Below are few snaps. Remaining photos can be seen at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/jangid/archives/date-taken/2007/08/03/&quot;&gt;http://flickr.com/photos/jangid/archives/date-taken/2007/08/03/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jangid/999548006/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1111/999548006_de8eeb919d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img_2009.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jangid/998712081/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1258/998712081_8020602f52.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img_2011.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jangid/999581514/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1384/999581514_dfe866e7bd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img_2014.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jangid/999618168/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1244/999618168_ca0a41836c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img_2020.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jangid/999686334/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1290/999686334_f4f3a8b046.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img_2030.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jangid/998880853/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1420/998880853_c36d5ad898.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img_2034.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;

         <title>Purpose</title>
         <link>http://lifedrill.blogspot.com/2007/08/purpose.html</link>
         <description>I have few other blogs but I have never been active enough in any of them. I am now seriously thinking of using this space as my diary. But to the best I'll try to update it once in 2-3 weeks. I am hoping to be serious this time. And for that, the next posting will be today only.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;
