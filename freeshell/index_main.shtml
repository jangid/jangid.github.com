    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born in a small town, Khetri Nagar, Rajasthan. I did my schooling in a Kendriya Vidyalaya. I wasn't a studious child in school but was an average student. Not much of sports but sometimes I used to take part in the neighbourhood cricket matches. The town was surrounded by a part of aravali mountain range. With my friends I used to go for hiking, without any trekking equipments. It wasn't a serious hiking as the hills were not very huge only 200-300 metres high. Sometimes we used to go for picnic on our bicycles to nearby places like Bhageshwar, Kolihan. And sometimes without bicycle to Khetri Fort.</p>
    <p>Me and my brother Peeyush used to play cricket inside our house. Many times we broke things by hitting either the bat or the ball; sometimes we managed to hide it from parents but not always lucky. My Father, Shree Satyanarayan Jangid, is an electronic hobbyist. And I used to sit beside him to see his experiments till very late in the night. My interest in engineering is due to my Father. He retired from a public sector company and now teaches physics to high school students.</p>
    <p>After spending 17 wonderful years at Khetri Nagar, I got serious about my carrier and applied for engineering and I was selected in state pre-engineering test. I went to Udaipur for engineering studies. I did BE in electricals. College days were a mix of studies, games and some politics. I was an average student there and managed to get 66% in my degree. I used to take part in sports, especially volleybal and I was a member of winning team in the university sports in my IIIrd year. Sometimes, I used to go to college gymnasiam also for some muscle building. I was elected general secretary of Engineering Student's Association (ESA) in IIIrd year.</p>
    <p>My areas of interests are Theory of Computer Sciences, Compilers, Programming Languages, Natural Language Technology and Operating Systems. I also like to experiment with the latest things in the field of software technology. Since I joined the industry, technology has changed many directions. Earlier the industry was desktop centric, then became network or web centric, and the future is take us in a supercomputing era. It is really moving very fast. Currently I am researching in Compilers.</p>
    <p>I started my carrier at National Centre for Software Technology (<a href="http://www.ncst.ernet.in">NCST</a>), Mumbai in the year 2000. It is a Government of India funded software research centre. In december, 2002 the organization has been merged into a bigger Government organization called <a href="http://www.cdacmumbai.com/">C-DAC</a>. I worked there for more than two and a half years and left NCST in April, 2003. Thereafter I shifted to New Delhi to work for <a href="http://www.spgindia.com/">SPG Solutions</a>. I worked with SPG for only eight months but I enjoyed the work. Then I moved to <a href="http://www.hcltechnologies.com/">HCL Technologies</a>, NOIDA. I worked at HCL for around 3 years and then moved to <a href="http://www.cadence.com/">Cadence Design Systems</a>, NOIDA. And working here since September, 2006.</p>
    <p>On 23rd Feb, 2003 I got married to Sarita. We were blessed with a baby girl on 4th November 2005. We named her Nainika. To see our photographs check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jangid">Flickr Home</a>.</p>
