<h2>27<sup>th</sup> Feb, 2003 - Mehrangar and Umed Bhavan</h2>
<p>
After we'd arrived in Jodhpur, we had to find a place to rest for a while and

wash up.  We went around looking for cheap hotels, but didn't like the look
of most of them.  Finally found a place called Surya guest house right in the
centre of town, opposite the cybercafe we had visited earlier in the week.
They gave us a bathroom with attached bedroom for Rs. 150, but we could only
stay for two hours.  That was enough.  While each person had a bath, the rest
of us slept.
</p>

<p>
The owner of the guest house allowed us to leave our bags at the reception
for the entire day, so we could roam around the city freely.  He got us a
rickshaw to take us first for breakfast and then around the city for Rs.200.
We had Kadi Kachoris for breakfast.  They were very tasty and we each had
three.

After breakfast we went to Mehrangar fort and Jaswant Tada.  Jaswant Tada is
a memorial for Maharaja Jaswant Singh, and Mehrangar is where he defended his
kingdom.
</p>

<p>
The fort is huge, and mainly converted into a museum that goes up four levels.
You can see the entire city from there.  Early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century,
the Maharaja moved to a new palace - the only one in the world to be built in
the 20<sup>th</sup> century.  One of the windows in the fort points directly
at this new palace.

On the ramparts are mounted 21 cannons of different types and sizes.  One
of the canons was taller than Jacob.  You can see the entire city of
Jodhpur from there, and it's quite a maze.
</p>

<p>
There were plenty of French tourists here too.  Here's some more pics from the
fort and Jaswant Tada:

After the fort, we headed to Umed Bhavan - the new palace.  The Maharaja
still lives there, and entertains guests in the lawns.  Half the palace

has been converted into a hotel that's maintained by the Welcome Group, while
a small portion is converted into a museum.  It contains the Maharaja's huge
clock collection, his silverware, some chinaware, and his polo trophies.
I guess it could double up as a store room as well - where he keeps all the
stuff he isn't using right now.
</p>

<p>
For lunch we went to a place called Bhavani Ghar.  They serve only one dish.
Daal Bati Churma.  And they make a profit from it.  We each had three batis -
<a href="big/rs-whats_the_time.jpg"
	onclick="return show_photo('rs-whats_the_time', 'What\'s the time?', 778, 508);"
	title="What's the time?"><img

	alt="What's the time?"
	height="134" width="205"
	style="margin-left: 5;float: right;" vspace="0" border="0"></a>


they were huge - with moong daal, and 60 grams of ghee.  Two churma laddus
were split amongst us.  Three of us had Chaas - served in Thums Up bottles.
</p>

<p>
What struck us most about Bhavani Ghar was the water.  After the salty water
that we were used to, it was surprisingly sweet.  The waiter told us that
they got it from the Kaliana lake just outside the city.  We filled our
bottles with that water.
</p>

<p>
From here on, we decided to use local bus transport to get around.  Our next
stop was Mandore - a park with loads of monkeys.  We had a short afternoon
nap here - no room see - and then roamed around.  There's cenotaphs here too,
but we didn't know of whom.  They also have some sort of amusement park in
there, but we didn't go in.
</p>

<p>
<a href="big/rs-joju_stop_hanging_about.jpg"
	onclick="return show_photo('rs-joju_stop_hanging_about', 'Joju stop hanging about', 762, 512);"
	title="Joju stop hanging about"><img

	alt="Joju stop hanging about"
	height="134" width="200"
	style="margin-right: 5;float: left;" vspace="0" border="0"></a>


We then spent some time walking around Mandore aimlessly and sending SMSes
back home.  Finally got into a city bus to get back to the city.  The city
bus service in Jodhpur is interesting.  The bus frequency is quite high, and
when a bus reaches a stop, it will wait there until the next bus arrives.
Each bus can seat about 18 people, and have a few standees.
</p>

<p>
Once we got back to the city, we went to a cybercafe - a different one - to
clean up our mail boxes and basically find out if anyone at work needed us
back.  Nothing.  Good.  We spent an hour there, watching Glenn McGrath take
7 Namibian wickets, and then Andy Bichel get into his rhythm which was to
later destroy England.
</p>

<p>
We then went across the road because Jacob needed to start a Juti shop in
Bombay.  He bought over half a dozen pairs of shoes and several camels.  We
hung around the shopping centre till they closed and then went to hotel
Poonam for dinner - a two minute walk away.  We had veg pulao and kashmiri
pulao, but it wasn't very good.
</p>

<p>
After dinner, went back to Surya to pick up our bags and head for the bus
station.  The good thing about being in the city centre is that everything is
just across the road.  The city bus stop was there too, so we caught a bus to
the Roadways bus stand.  That's when Mehta realised that he didn't have his
cap with him.  He ran back to Poonam, and found it there.
</p>

<p>
Our bus for Udaipur was to leave at 10:30, and it was empty.  It was to
arrive at 5am, but was early <img src="icons/sad.png" alt=":(" align="middle">
