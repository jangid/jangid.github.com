Shifted to a new location in East of Delhi. Its Mayur Vihar. It is a nice place. For those who visited my last residence, its not like that congested area. 

Started packing on friday night. And the next morning. When Sarita was preparing breakfast I went out side, to negotiate with a transport company, and hired a TATA 407. Sarita got angry as I didn't give any indication of where I was going. Nobody at home was prepared and I brought the truck. She was shouting ... and I was just busy in packing with one of my friends.

After some time with the help of one of my relatives, hired some labour. They thrown everything from balcony into the truck. One funny thing that happened,

Labour: Ye saman kahan jayega

My relative: Ye is balcony sa seedha neeche truck me jayega.....aur uske baad kahan jayega ye sochne ki zaroorat nahin. Apna kaam karo...

Me and my friend: Laughing...

Then came my cousin with his army Jipsy. Captain B.L. Jangid. He was with Bhabhi. Me and Sarita sat with them in their Jipsy. And the truck was following us. On the way a Traffic Police wala stopped the truck. And my friend who was in truck called me and we reversed and the traffic wala just started smiling after seeing the Army ka gadi and left us. Then we decided to follow the truck so that if anybody stops the truck we can show our Army Jipsy. Ha haâ€¦

So we reached the new place, finally. In the apartment the security wala arranged for the labour.

This is the first time Sarita is seeing the house. It was too... dirty. But I was preparing her mentaly for last 2-3 days so it was not much of a surprise for her. She with the help of society workers cleaned the house. It took the whole Saturday and Sunday to cleanup everything. Any way its done now. And any body comming to Delhi is welcomed to my new rented house.
