If I buy a phone from US then it may or may not work in India depending upon the frequency band supported by the phone.

Generally sony ericsson phones in US come with support for networks - GSM 850, 1800, 1900 in India they sell devices with support for networks - GSM 900, 1800, 1900.

As I am going there for sometime I am thinking of buying an instrument from there. But I am looking for one which support all networks of India as well.

I think the network supported by Hutch in delhi is GSM 900. Idea supports 1800 or 1900. Can someone help me in finding a good cell which I can buy in US and work in India as well?
