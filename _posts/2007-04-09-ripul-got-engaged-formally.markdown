Ripul and Preeti officially got engaged during the Ring Ceremony yesterday. Hope everybody has booked tickets to reach New Delhi on 2nd or latest by 3rd morning. 3rd May is the marriage date.

Train Options (3AC) :-

1057 AMRITSAR EXPRES 23:45\\
2137 PUNJAB MAIL 19:10\\
2449 GOA SMPRK K EXP 21:15\\
2903 GOLDENTEMPLE ML 21:25\\
2925 PASCHIM EXPRESS 11:35\\
2951 MUMBAI RAJDHANI 16:40\\
2953 AUG KR RAJ EXP 17:40\\
2617 MANGALA LDWEEP 13:50

Rajdhani has return fare of around Rs. 3000/- other trains have fare of around Rs. 2400/-

Air options currently selling tickets for roughly around Rs. 6000/- (return tickets)

I would not recommend Bus as that would be much more tiring. ;)
