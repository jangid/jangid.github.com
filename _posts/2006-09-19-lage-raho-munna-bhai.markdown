Saw this movie twice and I liked the way it presents the Gandhian philosophy of Ahimsa and Satyagrah. But when I was seeing the movie I was thinking that someone will surely challenge the movie for the modified Vande Mataram song (Vande Mataram, Bande mein tha dum).

Well that didn't happen. But suddenly 2-3 days back I was a news on Aaj Tak that some NSUI (the student organization supported by Congress) students in some city (I don't remember which) gathered and demanding that the word "Gandhigiri" be removed from movie.

While watching the movie I didn't even realize that this word is doing any harm to sentiments of people or showing disrespect to the Bapu. But then when I saw the news footage about the NSUI people, I realized that they were not even serious in agitation...they were just laughing and making fun. I hope this was just to attract media and not to really ban the movie.
