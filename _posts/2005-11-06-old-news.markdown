“Sarge” is released 4 days back, but I came to know of this only when my net connection was fixed yesterday and I did an aptitude update. My /etc/apt/source.list file has following entries,

deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US sarge/non-US main
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ sarge main

deb http://security.debian.org/ sarge/updates main

I noticed that there are no updates even after 2-3 days. Went to debian home page and found 3.1 is released. It was just 4 days after 3.0r6's release.
