I told my team here that wikipedia.org is a nice site to find definitions and explations to almost all the terms that we use. Now people here have one dedicated window of browser for it. And moreover they discovered that it is also available in sanskrit (sa.wikipedia.org).

More and more wikipedia users from here !
