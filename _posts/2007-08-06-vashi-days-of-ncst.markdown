Today I got few old photos from Rahul. Luckily he had those NCST photos also when the NCST, New Bombay centre was at Vashi, right above the Vashi railway station.

`pic here`

The photo shows 90% of the Vashi team (Binoy, Jacob, Bhavana, Dharmesh, Pankaj and Ripul). Subbu and Meghna are missing.

Me used to come from Powai, Ripul from Bombay central. Mostly we joined each other at Kurla while going to office in the morning. In the evening most of the days we left office at around 9:00 PM, till we both shifted to NCST rented residence at Seawoods Complex between Belapur and Vashi.

I remember we used to eat Jacobs Dabba (lunch box) for lunch and then used to go for Pops Jumbo Vada-Pav. Sometimes other places also especially Alibaba for a Chinese treat. In the evening we used to eat at home till we shifted to Seawoods.

After shifting the Seawoods team grew to 6 (Sasi, Joju, Pankaj, Ripul, Dharmesh, Prem) and hence we planned to cook our dinner ourself. Sasi and Joju and Prem also were the coach for our team and within no time we became South Indian cooking expert. I was assigned the task of cutting vegetables and later given the designation of Official Vegetable Cutter.

Nice days.
