About a month ago we all (Abhilash, Dinesh and Me) started going to the company gymnasium with different motives. Despite having good looks, Abhilash had a misunderstanding that he doesn't look good. And to rectify that he started regular workout everyday. Me want to build some muscle now. I know it is late. But it is never late you know. Dinesh has a deep back and want to fill that with muscles.


Many things happen on our way to wisdom. Dinesh separated from as he joined Sequence Design. But Abhilash's achievement was surprising. He lost 10 Kg in a month. Check his full advice at http://kahani-zindagi-ki.blogspot.com/2007/08/blog-post_7519.html. And we need no more reasons to celebrate. We started asking for a party when he lost 9.5 Kg. He promised to throw a party when he complete a 10 Kg loss. We said ok.

Although Abhilash tried hard to keep his weight loss below 10 Kg but yesterday he was 11.5 Kg less then from where he started. We reminded him of his promise. Ripul insisted on a dinner party. But we couldn't decide. After sometime Abhilash leaked the secret of Dal-Bati. And Ripul again insisted on a dinner party with Dal-Bati in the course. Abhilash agreed.


All of us left office at 5:00 PM. Abhilash went home to help Uma prepare a nice treat for all of us and we (Ripul and me) headed towards my home to pick Sarita and Naini. Then picked up Preeti from her office and reached Kendriya Vihar, Sector 50, NOIDA at Abhilash's residence for a mouth watering supper. Rahul was busy in some teleconference so could not attend the party.

All had more than twice our usual capacity. The meal was so tasty that we couldn't resist taking more and more and more...seriously. Now I know the secret behind Abhilash's weight gain. Abhilash resisted too much but couldn't help much. He also ate twice then his usual diet. Then we had sweets also. Over all a very well hosted treat.

Thanks Abhilash and Uma for the best hospitality. But Abhilash, now you should start eating full diet, leaving your specialized low calorie meal. Now you look super cool.
