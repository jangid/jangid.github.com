It was enlightening listening to this [Paper on Hinduism - Vivekananda](https://archive.org/details/SwamiVivekanandaWelcomeAddressVivekananda).

This is a 30 minute speech. After listening I am amazed at the simplicity with which he has put the complex things. Nothing special about Hinduism but this is more about spirituality.
