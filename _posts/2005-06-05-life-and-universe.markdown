Have we seen the smallest particle? I don't think anybody knows an answer. Who knows if there is another universe inside the smallest particle which we haven't seen. And who knows if we are lying inside a particle which is yet to be seen by some other forms of life in this universe. I am searching for this undisclosed secret for quite sometime now. But I think even searching for an answer is also not the right direction. Because there will always be more unanswered questions than answered.
