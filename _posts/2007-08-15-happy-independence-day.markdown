Congratulations India. Congratulations All of Us.

India is celebrating 60th Independence Day today. We celebrated the Independence in our society by organizing a flag hosting ceremony followed by sports activities. All were happy, especially kids who got gifts. Those who won got special prizes. Naini and Dhruv also got special prizes for best dressed girl and boy (see photo). Click here to see all photos taken on 15 August, 2007.

Apart from this I watched the movie "Shaheed" that was being played on Doordharshan. I have watched this movie many times but the freshness is still there. I can watch it infinite times. I would like to request here to the producer to digitally enhance the movie and convert it to color. So many movies are being converted why not such a great movie.

Enjoy the day. And write how you celebrated the Independence Day.

Jai Hind.
