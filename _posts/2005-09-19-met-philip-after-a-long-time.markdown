After a long time (2 year) I met Philip. And it was really nice to seem him here at Delhi. But unfortunately I missed his talk :( titled "Becoming a Geek" or "Being a Geek" (don't remember exactly). All this was due to the jumbled up schedule.

It feels so great when you meet some one you know after a long time. Really. :)
